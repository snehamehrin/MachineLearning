**Machine Learning Projects**

**Overview**

This project showcases some ML projects that I have done using publicly available datasets.

**Project Introduction**

1. Quora Duplicate Prediction Questions

In this project, I performed extensive EDA and Feature Engineering using Fuzzy matching and NLP to predict duplicate questions.

2 Personalized cancer diagonosis**

In the second project, I used NLP and machine Learning techniques such as SVM & Ensemble techniques to identify the cancer genes.

3. Facebook follower prediction

In the final project, I used graph theory to predict the number of followers in facebook.
